## 🎨 Features Overview

### What Makes AlgoSketch Stand Out?

#### 1. **Interactive Learning Experience**
Unlike static tutorials, AlgoSketch lets you see algorithms in action. Pause, step through, rewind, and understand exactly what's happening at each moment.

#### 2. **Visual Clarity**
Two visualization modes (bars and nodes) help different learning styles. Color-coded elements show you what's being compared, swapped, or already sorted.

#### 3. **Complete Learning Package**
- Algorithm explanation with step-by-step walkthrough
- Visual representation with real-time statistics
- Multi-language code implementations
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Practical use cases and optimizations

#### 4. **Accessibility First**
Built with Radix UI components ensuring keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and WCAG compliance.

#### 5. **Progressive Web App**
Install AlgoSketch on your device and use it offline. Perfect for studying on the go!
